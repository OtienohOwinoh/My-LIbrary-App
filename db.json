            "description": "The instant New York Times bestseller* *Financial Times Book of the Month* ‘A supremely practical and useful book.’ Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck ________________________________ A revolutionary system to get 1 per cent better every day People think when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions – doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life. ________________________________ ‘James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits. This engaging, hands-on book is the guide you need to break bad routines and make good ones.’ Adam Grant, author of Originals ‘A special book that will change how you approach your day and live your life.’ Ryan Holiday, author of The Obstacle is the Way Buy Atomic habits online in Kenya from rafubooks.com delivered to your doorstep | Rafubooks.com online bookstore Ken",

            "description": "The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason is a personal financial classic and a book that I have enjoyed. It was written in 1926 and has a poetic style, telling stories with financial concepts in the form of parables. These stories not only discuss our relationship with money but also a broader life philosophy. It’s concept oriented and meant to stand the test of time without using financial jargon. The book illustrates the purpose and meaning that we can create in our life by using money wisely. We often get caught up in the details of a certain investment or account type but this book takes a step back and addresses fundamental wealth creation principles to live a happier, more prosperous life in the long-hall.",

            "description": "It starts with a girl. Girls actually. Its only fair that it starts with a girl, no? Only problem is that most stories that start with a girl always end up with someone banging on the door saying; I just want to talk. This is not one of those stories. This one is about Larry. Mad Larry. He drinks. He shags girls. He hates his father. And he looks nothing like his step brother, who stays by his side throughout his madness. When Larry does something terrible, it looms over him, shaping his future, transforming all the relationships around him and hurtling him into a rabbit hole. Oh, and wheelbarrows are involved. Five of them. Somehow Larry and one of these wheelbarrows will collide and things will get pretty hairy - for Larry, that is, not for you, dear reader.
